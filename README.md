# budget-app-backend

This is a fully typesafe api. It uses typescript and zod for input validation completed as part of Pursuits, full stack developer track. The objective was to create a front end repo using react and a back end repo with express and node.js. After completing the project I migrated the project the typescript and added a local postgress database as the backend.



The demo is deployed [here](https://budget-app-o1zu.onrender.com). (ðŸ˜… Since the project was migrated to postgress, the database will need to be hosted as well. This is under development.)
